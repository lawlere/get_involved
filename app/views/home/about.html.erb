	<div id="problem">
	<h1>The Problem:</h1>
	<p1> Young women and girls in developing countries (specifically Kenya) are facing issues such as Female Genitial Mutilation, violence, rape, financial dependence on their <br> husbands and fathers, and extreme poverty. 85% of all Kenyan households that are ran by women, live in extreme poverty. 75% of women in Kenya are pregnant and <br> married by the time they are 20 years old. All of these problems occur because these young women are dependant on the males in their society, both financially <br> and emotionally. </br></br></br> </p1> 
		</div>
			<div id="solution">	
		<h3> Our Solution: </h3>
	<p2> We want to help these young women gain the power of independence and drastically change their lives of human rights abuses and extreme poverty. We want to <br> provide them with the entrepreneurial tools that they need in order to create their own business venture and inspire concious capitalism in their socieites and tribes. <br> Technology, along with mentorship, is the main tool that we are going to provide. By engaging women (specifically younger women) here in the United States, we plan <br> to crowdfund technology packages to individual women and girls in Kenya. On this crowdfunding site, you can read each girls' story and determine how much you <br> would like to contribute to her success. The technology packages will consist of a technological device, data, and applications specifically chosen by successful <br> entrepreneurs to jump start their venture. We, also, plan to provide a guide on how to use the device and entrepreneurial mentoring for these girls.</br></br></br></br></br></p2>
